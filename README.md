## Intro

Saka Key lets you navigate the web with just your keyboard. It differs from existing vi-inspired Chrome extensions on four fronts:

1. Its state machine [architecture](./notes/developer_guide.md) is modular, extensible, and **SIMPLE**. It is designed to be as easy as possible to add complex features with minimal effort and understanding of the codebase.

2. It's not vim. Aesthetics matter and graphical menus takes preference over text configuration. It's friendly to non-developers. You shouldn't need a tutorial, but there is one

3. It's engineered for configurability. The Settings GUI is generated from simple JSON files to encourage authors to make modes configurable. Any changes to a setting are automatically propogated to all tabs without requiring a page refresh. Saka Key supports _settings profiles_ that are easy to switch between and sensible default settings profiles are supported. Per-domain profiles coming soon.

4. It's built with modern web tooling (as of 2017): ES6+, Webpack, Preact... no Coffeescript to be seen. These tools weren't selected just because they're hip and new. Saka Key would be something entirely different without native asynchronous support, ES6 Modules, and a functional UI library.

## Install


### Install on Chrome

1. Run the following commands in your terminal to clone and build Saka Key.
  An extension you can run will be generated in the 'dist' directory.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/lusakasa/saka-key.git
  cd saka-key
  npm install
  npm run build:chrome
  # or if you want to generate an optimized production build
  npm run build:prod:chrome
  ```

2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`

3. Enable developer mode and click 'Load Unpacked Extension'

4. Select the dist directory, and &#128640;.

5. Refresh existing tabs to load Saka Key into them

### Install on Firefox

1. Run the following commands in your terminal to clone and build Saka Key.
  A zipped extension named 'dist-firefox.zip' will be generated in the root directory.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/lusakasa/saka-key.git
  cd saka-key
  npm install
  npm run build:prod:firefox
  ```

2. Navigate to `about:config`

3. Search for the entry `xpinstall.signatures.required` and set it to `false` (beware: this will allow installing unsigned extension from files)

4. Navigate to `about:addons`

5. Click the gear icon in the upper right corner and select "Install Add-on From File..."

6. Select the `dist-firefox.zip` file

7. Firefox will load Saka Key automatically into all valid existing tabs

## Development Tips

Save yourself some trouble and read the [Developer Guide](./notes/developer_guide.md). It explains the basics of how Saka Key works.

Check out the [doc](./doc) folder to learn about Saka Key's design.

Saka Key is developed together with:

* Mosi - a messaging library for Chrome extensions: [github](https://github.com/eejdoowad/mosi), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mosi)

You may have to debug or modify Mosi when contributing to saka key. To use your local copy of Mosi when building Saka Key:

1. Navigate to Mosi's root directories.
2. Run `npm link`
3. Navigate to the root of Saka key.
4. Run `npm link mosi`
