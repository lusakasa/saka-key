**This tutorial uses the default profile's keybindings.**

Some pages, like Gmail and GitHub, provide keyboard shortcuts you might want to use instead of Saka Key's keyboard shortcuts. You can pass keys directly to a page so you can use the page's shortcuts.

To pass a single key, type <kbd>;</kbd>. The next key you type will be passed to the page.

If you want to keep passing keys, type <kbd>shift-;</kbd>. All subsequent keys  will be passed to the page. To stop passing keys, type <kbd>ctrl-x</kbd>.
