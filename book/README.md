## Motivation

> The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.

*Tim Berners-Lee,
Inventor of the World Wide Web*

When the web isn't accessible, it's because people who author content don't understand the benefit of making it accessible. Saka Key leverages accessibility information to make the browsing experience better for *everyone*. I hope this will encourage the creation of accessible content.

Keyboard shortcuts are only the beginning of this journey. Screen reading and voice commands are on the roadmap.
